Therefore, 'A' will appear upside-down." },
            { question: "2) What will be the water image of 'M'?", options: ["Looks same", "Upside-down", "Reversed", "Distorted"], answer: "Looks same", explanation: "Letters like 'M' that have vertical symmetry appear the same in a water reflection." },
            { question: "3) Which number remains unchanged in a water reflection?", options: ["0", "8", "3", "5"], answer: "8", explanation: "The number '8' has horizontal symmetry, so its water reflection looks the same." },
            { question: "4) What happens to the letter 'E' in a water image?", options: ["No change", "Flipped upside-down", "Reversed", "Rotated 90°"], answer: "Flipped upside-down", explanation: "The water image of 'E' is its upside-down version." },

            { question: "7) The number '6' in water image will look like?", options: ["6", "9", "8", "3"], answer: "9", explanation: "The water reflection of '6' is '9'." },
            { question: "8) How will the letter 'T' appear in water reflection?", options: ["Same", "Flipped horizontally", "Upside-down", "Distorted"], answer: "Same", explanation: "The letter 'T' has horizontal symmetry, so its water reflection looks the same." },
            { question: "9) What is the water image of '2025'?", options: ["5202", "2025", "2520", "Ɩɔɔ"], answer: "5202", explanation: "Each digit is reflected upside-down: 2 becomes 5, 0 remains 0, and 5 becomes 2." },

            { question: "12) What will be the water image of 'CAT'?", options: ["ƆAΓ", "ТАƆ", "TAC", "ΓƆA"], answer: "ΓƆA", explanation: "Each letter is reflected upside-down: C becomes Ɔ, A becomes A, and T becomes Γ." },
            { question: "13) A triangle with base down is placed above water, what happens?", options: ["Upside-down", "Flipped horizontally", "No change", "Distorted"], answer: "Upside-down", explanation: "Reflecting a shape across a horizontal axis inverts it vertically." },
            { question: "14) The water image of 'E' will look like?", options: ["3", "E", "W", "F"], answer: "F", explanation: "The water reflection of 'E' is 'F'." },
