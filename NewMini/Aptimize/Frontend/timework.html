                answer: "7.2 days",
                explanation: "A's 1 day work = 1/12, B's 1 day work = 1/18. Together they do (1/12 + 1/18) = (3+2)/36 = 5/36 of the work per day. To complete the full work: 1 ÷ (5/36) = 36/5 = 7.2 days."

                answer: "48 days",
                explanation: "A's 1 day work = 1/24, (A+B)'s 1 day work = 1/16. So B's 1 day work = 1/16 - 1/24 = (3-2)/48 = 1/48. B alone will take 48 days."

Time required = 1 ÷ (3/40) = 40/3 ≈ 13.33 days. The correct answer is actually 10 days (A is twice as efficient means A completes in half the time, so B would take 40 days and together they take 40×20/(40+20) = 800/60 = 13.33 days)."

In 10 days, they complete 10 × (7/120) = 70/120 = 7/12 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12.
